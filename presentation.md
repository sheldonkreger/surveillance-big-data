# Presentation

The year is 2029, and political tensions in the United States have reached a tipping point. Unemployment has recently reached 15%, with truckers replaced by autonomous vehicles, cashiers replaced by RFID scanners, and call centers replaced with deceptively responsive converstaion bots. Next year, Silicon Valley startup CyberLife will drop the cost of its general-purpose, humanoid robot from $75,000 per unit to just $15,000, which could push people in manufacturing, janitorial, landscaping, and farming out of work.

The political responses have been intense, but there is no universal agreement upon where to place the blame, or what to do. Instead, a gridlock between conservatives and liberals in the US has formed. Conservatives believe the virtue of the market, and reject the idea of restraining emerging technologies or ensuring living conditions for the growing number of homeless. Liberals see believe in the virute of the technology to alleviate humans from the burden of labor, but have not been successful in protecting the unemployed or in helping displaced workers retrain and find new jobs.

Robert, a 27 year old white man living in Chicago, has grown so uneasy that he recently shoved a man halfway across the bus after a brief argument about a seat. Robert, already struggling to make rent, lost the automated bid on a key project and overboiled when the suit-and-collar man who tried to shove his way into the last seat. He had been banned from the bus system for a few weeks, but never faced any criminal charges.

Robert's problems came from every direction at once. After his sister was killed in the previous year in an autonomous vehicle accident, the courts ruled in favor of the manufacturer. And, after spending months sending messages to women through online dating apps, had finally realized he had been 'shadow banned', where his profile was only matched with inactive accounts and his messages ended up in a virutal trash bin. It had been nearly four years since he'd had sex, and the sum of all these anxieties was taking its toll.

The algorithms had taken his sister, his work, and his love life away. Looking around, he knew he wasn't alone in his desparate loneliness.

The only good news for Robert was the recent passing of his grandmother, who left behind a hefty estate from her Los Angeles home, which was sold and the earnings split between Robert and his parents. This was enough for Robert to finally move on, to move *away*, and to finally make a statement that nobody would forget.

One of Robert's hobbies was drone photography, and he was active in a number of online groups. Over the last few years, he had seen many drone customizations, and even tried a few himself. One technique was using micro-drones in a swarm configuration to surround a person with cameras and render a 3D image. Robert's creativity was outpaced only by his growing anger, and over the last year or so, he'd been looking at how weapons could be attached to drones and piloted for destruction. This had spawned a plan for revenge against the industry that had destroyed his life.

With his newly acquired funds, he went online and ordered a small army of high-speed microdrones - each about three inches in length. He also purchased an industrial 3D printer, which would easily render long, razer-sharp nails and brackets to attach to each drone. He ordered a total of 10,000 drones from 30 suppliers, some domestic and some international, and also downloaded the bluebrints for the 3D printer. A custom script he crafted utilized facial attributes to target middle aged, white and Asian males - the demographic of Silicon Valley engineers. After a few weeks of assembly and some test runs, Robert rented three vans in San Franscisco, loaded them with the drones, and at 11:30am on a Tuesday, released an unprecedented force of violence in the city.

Although my writing is certainly not on par-with that of the Netflix series *Black Mirror*, I do think that Robert's story can help us gain perspective of the growing power of individual actors and how surveillance might be used to thwart them. First, we'll explore the philisophical argument that science will inevitably create technologies which create existential risk. Second, we'll explore some of the most immediately emerging threats in this space, and argue that surveillance will be a critical line of defense. Third, we will point out today's current misuse of surveillance - we'll detail how private companies currently exploit their customers through surviellance and big data systems, actively manipulating people to purchase products or participate in other agendas through a process called *instrumentarianism*. Third, we will see how governmental surveillance is legally distinguished from these corporate endeavors, but that corporate data is invaluable for thwarting future threats.
