## Introduction

The year is 2029, and political tensions in the United States have reached a tipping point. Unemployment has recently reached 15%, with truckers replaced by autonomous vehicles, cashiers replaced by RFID scanners, and call centers replaced with deceptively responsive converstaion bots. Next year, Silicon Valley startup CyberLife will drop the cost of its general-purpose, humanoid robot from $75,000 per unit to just $15,000, which could push people in manufacturing, janitorial, landscaping, and farming out of work.

The political responses have been intense, but there is no universal agreement upon where to place the blame, or what to do. Instead, a gridlock between conservatives and liberals in the US has formed. Conservatives believe the virtue of the market, and reject the idea of restraining emerging technologies or ensuring living conditions for the growing number of homeless. Liberals see believe in the virute of the technology to alleviate humans from the burden of labor, but have not been successful in protecting the unemployed or in helping displaced workers retrain and find new jobs.

Robert, a 27 year old white man living in Chicago, has grown so uneasy that he recently shoved a man halfway across the bus after a brief argument about a seat. Robert, already struggling to make rent, lost the automated bid on a key project and overboiled when the suit-and-collar man who tried to shove his way into the last seat. He had been banned from the bus system for a few weeks, but never faced any criminal charges.

Robert's problems came from every direction at once. After his sister was killed in the previous year in an autonomous vehicle accident, the courts ruled in favor of the manufacturer. And, after spending months sending messages to women through online dating apps, had finally realized he had been 'shadow banned', where his profile was only matched with inactive accounts and his messages ended up in a virutal trash bin. It had been nearly four years since he'd had sex, and the sum of all these anxieties was taking its toll.

The algorithms had taken his sister, his work, and his love life away. Looking around, he knew he wasn't alone in his desparate loneliness.

The only good news for Robert was the recent passing of his grandmother, who left behind a hefty estate from her Los Angeles home, which was sold and the earnings split between Robert and his parents. This was enough for Robert to finally move on, to move *away*, and to finally make a statement that nobody would forget.

One of Robert's hobbies was drone photography, and he was active in a number of online groups. Over the last few years, he had seen many drone customizations, and even tried a few himself. One technique was using micro-drones in a swarm configuration to surround a person with cameras and render a 3D image. Robert's creativity was outpaced only by his growing anger, and over the last year or so, he'd been looking at how weapons could be attached to drones and piloted for destruction. This had spawned a plan for revenge against the industry that had destroyed his life.

With his newly acquired funds, he went online and ordered a small army of high-speed microdrones - each about three inches in length. He also purchased an industrial 3D printer, which would easily render long, razer-sharp nails and brackets to attach to each drone. He ordered a total of 10,000 drones from 30 suppliers, some domestic and some international, and also downloaded the bluebrints for the 3D printer. A custom script he crafted utilized facial attributes to target middle aged, white and Asian males - the demographic of Silicon Valley engineers. After a few weeks of assembly and some test runs, Robert rented three vans in San Franscisco, loaded them with the drones, and at 11:30am on a Tuesday, released an unprecedented force of violence in the city.

Although my writing is certainly not on par-with that of the Netflix series *Black Mirror*, I do think that Robert's story can help us gain perspective of the growing power of individual actors and how surveillance might be used to thwart them. First, we'll explore the philisophical argument that science will inevitably create technologies which create existential risk. Second, we'll explore some of the most immediately emerging threats in this space, and argue that surveillance will be a critical line of defense. Third, we will point out today's current misuse of surveillance - we'll detail how private companies currently exploit their customers through surviellance and big data systems, actively manipulating people to purchase products or participate in other agendas through a process called *instrumentarianism*. Third, we will see how governmental surveillance is legally distinguished from these corporate endeavors, but that corporate data is invaluable for thwarting future threats. Finally, we will look at a real-world example of a state/corporate hybrid surveillance system and its controversial nature.

## Vulnerable World Hypothesis

Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom specializes in the ethics of near-future problems such as human enhancement, artificial intelligence, and existential risk. In a recent paper, he lays the philosophical groundwork to argue that the scientific method will inevitably lead to technologies which pose danger to the survival of humanity.

Imagine an urn filled with balls that are white, black, and various shades of grey. Each time an invention is brought to life, humanity reaches into the urn and draws a ball. The white balls represent technologies which are generally positive for humanity, while the black balls represent inventions which lead to extinction. And, of course, there are many grey balls which exhibit both positive and negative traits. Thankfully, most of the balls so far have been grey or white. Bostrom, however, believes that in the near future, we will be pulling some dark grey or even black balls, and without some kind of social framework to address them, this will result in a major catastrophe.

For example, the rapid developments in the biotech industry have enabled smaller labs to conduct more powerful research. Restrictions on technologies used to manufacture, say, a lethal virus, are currently inadequate in context of the amount of damage such a bioweapon could cause. Each year, these materials become accessible to more people at a lower cost, making it more and more likely that a rogue agent or small sect will implement a bioweapon attack. We will explore further examples later.

> Intuitively, the hypothesis is that there is some level of technology at which civilization almost certainly gets destroyed unless quite extraordinary and historically unprecedented degrees of preventive policing and/or global  governance are implemented. More precisely:
>>
> -VWH: If technological development continues then a set of capabilities will at some point be attained that make the devastation of civilization extremely likely, unless civilization sufficiently *exits* the semi-anarchic default condition. (pg 6)

The "semi-anarchic default conditions" are:

> - Limited capacity for preventive policing. States do not have sufficiently reliable means of real-time surveillance and interception to make it virtually impossible for any individual or small group within their territory to carry out illegal actions—particularly actions that are very strongly disfavored by >99% of the population.
> - Limited capacity for global governance. There is no reliable mechanism for solving global coordination problems and protecting global commons—particularly in high-stakes situations where vital national security interests are involved.
> - Diverse motivations. There is a wide and recognizably human distribution of motives represented by a large population of actors (at both the individual and state level)—in particular, there are many actors motivated, to a substantial degree, by perceived self-interest (e.g. money, power, status, comfort and convenience) and there are some actors (“the apocalyptic residual”) who would act in ways that destroy civilization even at high cost to themselves. (pg 7)

It is important to frame the conversation around surveillance, big data, and privacy from this perspective. Later, I will argue that although such threats may justify a broad expansion of state authority and diminished privacy, they do not justify universal application of these tools to general criminal justice or corporate profiteering.
