# The Future of Violence
## The Distribution of Vulnerability

Technological changes create both greater security, and new opportunities for insecurity. For example, biomedicine has given us more security with our health - new treatments to diseases, improvements in sanitation, and so on. At the same time, these kinds of improvements also open the door for threats like bioweapons and superbugs.

Similarly, cloud data storage and widespread data collection has created a 'digital mosaic' of individual behavioral information which has has created security of our information from physical damage (no more losing your files if your PC is broken), but at the expense of the concentration of security power. This has both pros and cons. For one, information security is now largely the responsibiltiy of experts who professionally ensure everybody's data is protected. The individual using Gmail, for example, need not worry about the technical details of how Google prevents hackers from viewing their emails. On the other hand, the individual also can't do much to protect the data on their own, either.

This concentration of data leaves nearly everybody vulnerable and dependent upon technological experts and policymakers for protection. On the same hand, a rogue actor in such systems can cause much more damage in a single attack.
