# The Future of Violence
## Introduction

The book opens with a hypothetical scenario in which the 2001 anthrax attacks had been intended to inflict maximum damage, rather than to target a handful of people. An attacker today could use readily-available, online instructions to create a drone which flies into a stadium and releases the spores. It also explains an example of a hacker named Luis Mijngos, who in 2011 pleaded guilty to wiretapping and hacking charges associted with 230 different people. Spying, today, is not just for "big brother", it is also for "little brother" - lone criminals who create their own surveillance systems to learn the details of other people's lives or finances. In some countries, the government would not have had authority to conduct and investigation and ultimately raid his house. Several further examples are given to show the challenge of crime, terrorism, and future technologies.

The primary lessons are listed:

> - Modern technology enables individuals to wield the destructive power of states.
> - Individuals, including you personally, can potentially be attacked with impunity from anywhere in the world.
> - Technology makes less relevant many of the traditional concepts around which our lawas and political organization for the security have evolved. National  borders, jurisdictional boundaries, citizenship, and the distinctions between national and international, between act of war and crime, and between state and private action all offer divides less sharp than they used to.
> - Our nation - and every nation - can face attack through channels controlled and operated not by governments but by the private sector and by means against which governments lack the ability to defend, making private actors pivotal to defense. (pg 10)
