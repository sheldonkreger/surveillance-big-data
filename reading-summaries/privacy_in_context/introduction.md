# Privacy in Context
## Introduction

In *Privacy in Context*, Nissenbaum presents a new framework to guide evaluation of privacy concerns. She argues that there are currently two categories in which all privacy discussions fall:
- Privacy concerns are argued as a fundamental right or value. The shortcoming here is that it is difficult or impossible to capture a coherent concept of these values which applies well in all (or most) situations.
- Privacy concerns are discussed as a conflict between the various interests of stakeholders. When a particular conflict arises between privacy and the market or defense needs, various parties 'brawl' to determine the boundaries of regulation. This is the dominant way that policy makers and courtrooms approach privacy. The primary problem with this approach is that it favors those who hold the most power and resources.

Nissenbaum's "framework of contextual integrity" falls between these two. Grounded by universal ethical standards, but looking toward the sky of real-world scenarios:

> . . . is the realm of the social, and it is in this realm that contextual integrity fits. This middle realm holds a key to explaining why people react to real-world disputes in the ways they do and why they ferquently express their alarm in terms of the erosion of privacy. Although it remains crucial to the understanding of these disputes that we grasp the configurations of interests, values and principles present in them, our capacity to explain them is diminished if we attend to these elements alone, blind to the sway of social strucures and norms. p. 11

Using social contexts as 'the building blocks' of the framework, Nissenbaum argues that privacy concerns are governed by context-relative social norms. These norms determine how data practitioners act, as well as how people respond to the many ways information is shared. No universal value can fully explain why we care when the NSA tracked phone metadata under the PATRIOT Act, but simultaneously we accept that telecommunications companies capture, use, and sell this data as part of daily operations. The contextual framework gives a better perspective on such problems.

The book also includes a step-by-step evaluation process called the CI Decision Heuristic, but the introduction does not describe it in detail.
