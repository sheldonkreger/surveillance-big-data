# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
## Big Other and the Rise of Instrumentarian Power

Having established the term *instrumentarian* and started the conversation about its ambitions in the context of psychologists like BF Skinner, Zuboff uses this chapter to clarify more terminology and to to document some history of instrumentarianism.

> SC is the puppet master that imposes its will through the medium of the ubiquitous digital apparatus. I now name the apparatus *Big Other*: It is the sensate, computational, connected puppet that renders, monitors, computes, and modifies human behavior. *Big Other* combines these functions of knowing and doing to achieve a pervasive and unprecendented *means of behavrioral modification.* Surveillance capitalism's economic logic is directed through Big Other's vast capabilities to produce instrumentarian power, replacing the engineering of souls with the engineering of behavior. (pg 376)

The gaze of the Big Other imposes analysis in an inhuman and cold manner:
> Thanks to Big Other's capabilities, instrumentarian pwoer reduces human experience ot measureable observable behavior while remaining steadfastly indifferent to the meaning of that experience. I call this new way of knowing *radical indifference*. It is a form of *observation without witness* that yields the obvers of an intimiant violent political religion and bears an uterly different signature of havoc: the remote and abstracted contempt of impenetrably complex systems and the interests that author them, carrying individuals on a fast-moving current to the fulfillment of others' ends. (pg 377)

Big Other dehumanizes its subjects by imposing analysis upon them as if they were objects. Individuals are no more than organisms that behave under the system. Instrumentarian power leverages this distanced manuevering to secure guaranteed outcomes in the market and to expand its power.

There is a key section starting on pg 384
