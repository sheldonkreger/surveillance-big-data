# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
## The Elaboration of Surveillance Capitalism: Kidnap, Corner, Compete

After spending four chapters outlining the history of SC, Zuboff dives into the details of what kind of data is being collected and how it is being leveraged to create profit. This gives us a sense of not only the scope of the data extraction process, but also the inescapability for its subjects - which is a key charactaristic of instrumentarian power.

The chapter begins with a revealing quote from Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet (the holding company for Google):
> Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience, making it beautifully simple, almost *automagical* because we undestand what you want and can deliver it instantly. (pg. 128)

Zuboff notes that:
> In the drive to fulfill this ambition, the extraction imperative produces a relentless push for scale in supply operations. There can be no boundaries that limit scale in the hunt for behavioral surplus, no territory exempted from plunder. (pg. 128)

This is one of the distinguishing traits of SC over earlier stages of capitalism:
> Traditionally, monopolies on goods and services disfigure markets by unfairly elimination competition in order to raise prices at will. Under SC, however, many of the practices defined as monopolistic actually function as a means of *cornering* user-derived raw-material supplies. . . In this picture it is we who are cornered. We are the source of the coveted commodity; our experience is the target of extraction. . . Regulatory interventions designed to constrain Google's monopoly pracitces are likely to have little effect . . . New supply routes are continuously discovered, opened, and secured. 

She then elaborates on the *dispossesion cycle*, in which behavioral data is extracted from the populace through surveillance. This process has four stages: Incursion, habituation, adaptation, and redirection.

First, a new technology facilitates the deployment of a new supply chain of behavioral data. The example used in the book is Google Street Views, a project where Google drove cameras through virtually every street in the world to enhance its Google Maps product. While there was initially resistance, Google was able to complete the project largely because its unprecedented nature circumvented traditional legal boundaries.

Gradually, or perhaps quickly, the extraction method becomes normalized under social and/or legal standards - habituation. In the case of Google Street View, the FCC tried and failed to contest some collection practices, and a union of 38 attorney generals managed to land a $7 million settlement for a specific abuse from one engineer, under an experimental program used in few neighborhoods. However:
> There are two key elements here which illuminate habituation tactices. The first is the simple fact of the time elapsed between Street View's initial incursion in 2007, the 2010 scandal, the 2012 conclusion of the FCC inquiry, and the 2013 conclusion of the states' investigation. . . The second point is that in retrospect, one sees the very idea of a single rogue engineer was designed and elaborated as a brilliant piece of misdirection, a classic scapegoating ploy.

This, of course, turned our focus away from the controversy of driving cameras through every street in the world.
