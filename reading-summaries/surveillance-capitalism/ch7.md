# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
## The Reality Business

Zuboff begins the second section of the book *The Advance of Surveillance Capitalism* by reviewing highlights of her research in Silicon Valley. Throughout the book, she mentions several years of work, which began in the early 2000s - primarily interviews with high ranking engineers, data scientists, and business executives. Although much of the material was lost in a house fire later on, these conversations clearly catalyzed Zuboff's intererest in the topic.

Referencing several public lectures, presentations, and articles from such individuals, Zuboff clarifies a narrative in which Silicon Valley businesses are racing for a complete system of surveillance and analysis. Through a rapidly expanding network of sensors, companies collect behavioral data and make predictions about future behavior. This data is currently used primarily to target advertisements to the consumers who are most likely to buy a product, based on mathematical analysis of previous behaviors. This process Zuboff calls *the prediction imperative* and is paired with the previously mentioned *extraction imperative*. And, of course, the unrestrained nature of capitalism means these imperatives have no boundaries, as long as they remain profitable.

After establishing this terminology, Zuboff begins to detail what is perhaps the most important and rousing thesis of her book:

> Behavioral surplus must be vast and varied, but the sureset way to predict behavior is to intervene at its source and shape it. The processes invented to achieve this goal are what I call *economies of action*. In order to achieve these economies, machine processes are configured to intervene in the state of play in the real world among real people and things. These intervetions are designed to enhance cerainty by doing things: they nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions by executing actions as subtle as inserting a specific phrase into your Facebook news feed, timing the appearance of a BUY button on your phone, or shutting down your car engine when an insurance payment is late.

>. . . Real world activity is continuously rendered from phones, cars, streets, homes, shops, bodies, trees, buildings, airports, and cities back to the digital realm, where it finds new life as data ready for transformation into predictions. 
>
>. . . Economies of action mean that real-world machine architectures must bea ble to know as well as to do. Extraction is not enough; now it must be twinned with execution. (pg 202-203)

The important detail is that currently:
> The aim of this undertaking is not to impose behavior norms, such as conformity or obedience, but rather to produce behavoir that reliably, definitively, and certainly leads to desired commercial results.

Zuboff then turns her gaze toward the most progressive technologies in development today, and begins building her case that the *instrumentarian* regime has goals far beyond commercial results. She begins with a review of recent work by an MIT Media Lab professor Joseph Paradiso, quoting him:

> Without ubiquitous sensate environments, the cognitive engines of this everywhere-enabled world are deaf, dumb, and blind, and can't respond relevantly to the treal-world events that they aim to augment. (pg 207)

His lab has developed not only low-profile sensors, but the "DoppeLab" - an integrated digital platform for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing sensor data. He writes:

> A proper interface to this artificial sensoria promises to produce . . . a digital omniscience . . . a pervasive everywhere augmented reality environment . . . that cona be intuitevely browsed . . . an extension of ourselves rather than an embodiment of an 'other'. . . information will stream directly to our eyes and ears once we enter the age of wearables . . .the boundaies of the individual will be very blurry in the future. (pg 208-209)

The goal is omniscience through digital mastery, allowing the system engineers to obvserve detailed and practical metrics about real-time activity, and deliver insights into behavioral modification systems.

The chapter continues to outline specific examples of companies making large investments into such systems, and their self-proclaimed desire for certainty in profit.
