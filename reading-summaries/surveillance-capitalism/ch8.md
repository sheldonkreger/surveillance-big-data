# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
## Rendition: From Experience to Data

This eighth chapter is dedicated to exemplifying ways in which corporations are currently amassing behavioral data and leveraging it in the marketplace. 

> We worry about companies that amass our personal data, and we wonder why they should profit. "Who owns the data?" we ask. But every discussion of data protection or data ownership omits the most important question of all: Why is our experience rendered as behavioral data in the first place? (pg 233)

The first example in this chapter is the iRobot product *Roomba*, a robotic vacuum cleaner. Upon releasing a new version of their more integrated robot which maps the user's home and sells the layout data to other companies, the company's shares jumped from $35 to $102 in just a year.

To show the interconnectedness of the sensor network and its marketplace, Zuboff explains the Sleep Number mattress, which can be connected to your fitness tracker, your Nest thermostat, and itself captures data on your sleep patterns. This allows the user to 'optimize' their thermometer settings in relation to the fitness and sleep data. Zuboff argues that this comes at the high cost of sharing personal data with corporations which are free to use it as they like. The mattress features a 12 page privacy policy which allows the company to resell the data as they see fit.

The next section details the rendition of the human body, begining with GPS tracking. Smart phones, of course, broadcast this data, often more than 5,000 times per day. And, even when such data is anonymized, a clever data scientist can easily extract the idiosyncratic mobility signatures and distinguish individual users in a large data set.

Zuboff mentions that the extraction imperative pushes collection devices further and further from the view of the subjects under observation. Wearables must be 'unobtrusive' and 'low cost' to appeal to the masses.

It is also noteworthy that facial recognition law is handled on the state, rather than the federal level in the USA. Facebook is a very powerful actor in this space, because of the huge volume of personal photos they have amassed in context of an individual's real name. In fact, they have effectively halted privacy protection legislation in Montana, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Alaska, and fatally weakened a bill in Washington state. (pg 252)
