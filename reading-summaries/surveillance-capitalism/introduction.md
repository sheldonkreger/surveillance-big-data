# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
## Introduction

In the introduction, Zuboff lays out the fundamental thesis of this substantial 700 page book.

1. Big data and surveillance technologies have created a surplus of behavioral data. Large companies leverage this data to influence individual decision making. This is a new form of power she calls *instrumentarianism.*
2. Instrumentarianism deserves its own terminology due to its unprecedented characteristics. The scope, granularity, and volume of information gathered and analyzed by large companies has created a concentration of a unique form of power.
   > The unprecedented nature of surveillance capitalism has enabled it to elude systematic contest because it cannot be adequately grasped with our existing concepts. We rely on categories such as 'monopoly' or 'privacy' to contest surveillance capitalist practices. And although these issues are vital . . . the existing categories nevertheless fall short in identifying and contesting the most cruicial and unprecedented facts of this new regime. (pg. 14)
3. Althogh most of today's instrumentarian motivations are profit-driven, those who hold this power are becoming increasingly interested in modifying behavior for social and political ends.
   > . . . Surveillance capitalism departs from the history of market capitalism in surprising ways, demanding both unimpeded freedom and total knowledge, abandoning capitalism's reciprocities with people and society, and imposing a totalizing collectivist vision of life in the hive, with surveillance capitalists and their data priesthood in charge of oversight and control. . . . As a result, surveillance capitalism is best descrtibed as a coup from above, not an overthrow of the state but rather an overthrow of the people's sovereignty and a prominent force in the perilous drift toward democratic deconsolidation that now threatens Western liberal democracies. (pg. 21)
